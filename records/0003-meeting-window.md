# 3. meeting window

Date: 2018-11-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Regularly during retrospectives the team agrees that too much time is spent during meetings.
In addition to this often meetings are organised with small breaks in between which results in frequent context switching

## Decision

Wherever possible compress meetings to fall within the window of 11am-2pm GMT.

Be considerate of lunch breaks and always leave at least a 30 minute gap, if not an hour during this window.

Meetings can be placed outside of this window but should be avoided if at all possible.

## Consequences

The team should find it easier to remain focussed on other tasks as there should be fewer interruptions throughout the day.
