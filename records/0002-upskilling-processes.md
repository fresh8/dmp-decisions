## Decision

* Where possible tickets should be picked up by a team member who is not the SME (Subject Matter Expert)
* Where possible SME is available to discuss approach and/or walk through existing codebase
* Utilise screenshare and pairing tools where possible

## Consequences

It is understood that this will add an additional overhead to most development work
